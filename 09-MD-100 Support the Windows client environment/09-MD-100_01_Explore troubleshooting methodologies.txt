Explore troubleshooting methodologies

The Enterprise Desktop Support Technician (EDST) is to act as an escalation point for problems that help-desk personnel can't resolve.
It also must support end users directly, and troubleshoot problems. However, an EDSTâ€™s responsibilities involve much more than simply fixing problems.
Desktop Administrators will frequently work directly with the EDST.

-Examine the Enterprise Desktop Support Technician role-

As an EDST, you should be:
* A good troubleshooter. An EDST can isolate an issue quickly by performing specific diagnostic tasks.
* A knowledgeable resource. You should be familiar with relevant products, and can perform hardware and software installation tasks, system monitoring, and maintenance.
* An effective communicator. Users may be distressed or upset, and you will need to manage these interpersonal and technical interactions simultaneously and effectively.
* An information source. Even if you do not know the answer, you need to know where to get the answer and when to escalate a problem.

Cloud-based infrastructure and services

Microsoft provides a number of cloud-based apps and services, including:
* Microsoft 365. Microsoft 365 delivers online versions of the Office applications and online business collaboration tools. Creating and managing Microsoft 365 accounts and apps is a common task for tier 1 help-desk staff and a tier 2 EDST.
* Microsoft Azure. This is a public cloud environment, and it provides a collection of Microsoft cloud services that you can use to build and operate cloud-based apps and information technology (IT) infrastructure.

Azure services allow you to:
* Create and operate cloud-based apps when you use a wide range of commonly used tools and frameworks.
* Host workloads in the cloud infrastructure that comprise virtual machines and virtual networks.
* Integrate cloud services with on-premises infrastructure.
