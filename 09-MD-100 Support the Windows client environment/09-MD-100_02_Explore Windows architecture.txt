Explore Windows architecture

When supporting Windows clients, it's important to understand the underlying fundamentals of how the Windows operating system functions.
This module provides information about the operating system’s architecture and supported devices, and introduces students to the Windows registry.

-Compare Windows client devices-

Form factors
* Desktop computers
* Laptop computers
* Convertible laptops
* Tablets

Factors that affect device selection
* Battery life.
* Processor performance
* Screen size, resolution, and graphics performance
* External expansion options
* Memory
* Storage

System services
System services include various executive services that provide distinct functions within the operating system, including:
* The I/O Manager manages I/O.
* The virtual memory manager controls virtualization of memory within the operating system.
* Other components within the executive control other aspects of the operating system.
* The application programming interface (API) sets enable Windows to support different types of apps. 

The Windows Runtime (RT) APIs enable the operating system to run Microsoft Store apps, whereas Win32 and related API sets enable the operating system to run traditional desktop apps.
Understand apps
* Traditional desktop apps, such as Office apps, use the Win32 APIs and Microsoft .NET Framework.
* Microsoft Store apps use the Windows RT APIs.

-Examine the Windows registry-

Key and subkeys
* HKCU\Control Panel\Desktop\Wallpaper is the value (Wallpaper) that stores the name and location of a user’s desktop wallpaper.
* HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run is the key that contains values that relate to programs that start automatically when the computer starts and a user signs in. Typically, these programs reside in the system tray.

-Use the Windows registry editor-

The Registry Editor tool
* Search the registry for a given value entry, value name, subkey, or key.
* Create, delete, and edit keys, subkeys, and values.
* Import entries into the registry from an external file.
* Export entries from the registry into an external file.
* Back up the registry (by exporting the entire registry).
* Connect to a remote computer and manage its registry.

Reg files
After you have created the .reg file, you can import the .reg file when you:
* Double-click the file and confirm that you want to continue.
* Run a script that loads the file. The following command imports the settings stored in setting1.reg without prompting the user to confirm:
* Open the Registry Editor, and use the import option to access the appropriate .reg file.

Windows PowerShell
To modify registry values, you must:
* Use the Set-Location cmdlet to change to the appropriate registry drive.
* Use the Set-ItemProperty cmdlet to assign a new value to the registry property.
