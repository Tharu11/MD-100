Explore physical hardware troubleshooting

If a Windows device does not function properly, you can expect many different types of issues, which can vary from simply being annoying to users to being detrimental to your environment.
For example, when a computer’s cooling fan produces a strange noise, a user’s productivity typically declines, and the hardware can overheat and fail.
All data that the user did not save before the hardware failure will be lost.

-Identify hardware-related problems-

Failure of device drivers

A device driver can fail for three primary reasons:
* Version incompatibility with the operating system. 
* Driver bugs
* Incorrect driver.

-Troubleshoot USB devices-

Device identification strings
* Hardware identifiers.
* Compatible identifiers.

To interpret the preceding and subsequent configuration files, use the following key:
* HID = Human Interface Device, such as keyboards and mice.
* VID = Vendor ID
* PID = Product ID

-Control USB device access-

In Windows, you can use Group Policy to control how USB devices access your computer. You can use Group Policy to:
* Prevent users from installing any device.
* Allow users to install only devices on an approved list.
* Prevent users from installing devices that are on a prohibited list.
* Deny read or write access to removable devices or removable media.
* More simple data security. 
* Reduced support costs.

However, controlling USB device installation could cause issues, including:
* Misdiagnosed faults.
* Policy management. 

-Troubleshoot wireless devices-

Users can connect many peripherals and devices to their computers when they use wireless connections. Two commonly used wireless technologies are:
* Bluetooth. 
* Wi-Fi. 

-Gather hardware information-

The Event Viewer tool
This category of logs includes four subtypes:
* Admin.
* Operational. 
* Analytic and Debug. 

The Reliability and Performance Monitor tools
The Reliability and Performance Monitor console includes two monitoring tools:
* Reliability Monitor.
* Performance Monitor. 

-Use best practices to troubleshoot hardware issues-

Best practices for troubleshooting hardware issues include:
* Verify hardware compatibility.
* Use Event Viewer and Device Manager for initial troubleshooting.
* Remove or disable recently installed device drivers.
* Use driver rollback to return to a previous driver version. 
* Consider upgrading the computer’s BIOS or firmware. 
* Use hardware vendor support.
* Follow the company incident reporting process.
