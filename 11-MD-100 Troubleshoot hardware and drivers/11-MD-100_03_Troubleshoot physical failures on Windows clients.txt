Troubleshoot physical failures on Windows clients

Hardware failures can be catastrophic unless you plan for them, as well as for data redundancy and regular backups.
You should have procedures in place so that you can troubleshoot failed devices efficiently, particularly for your most vulnerable devices such as hard disk drives and memory. 
You should also know the SLA that your company has with respect to device failures, and your organization’s procedure for replacing hardware components.
If the failed component includes data, such as a hard disk drive, you might have a special process for discarding these devices to protect the stored data’s confidentiality.

Hard disk drives
There are five main reasons why hard disk drives fail:
* Logical failure. 
* Mechanical failure.
* Electronic failure.
* Firmware failure. 
* Bad sector. 

Power supplies
Symptoms of power supply problems can include:
* No indicator lights, disk action, or screen display.
* On/Off indicator lights are visible, but there is no disk action or screen display.
* The system produces a continuous beep.

Optical drives
The media quality in optical drives is a significant factor in the length of the optical drive’s life:
* Higher-quality media can increase a device’s life.
* Unclean media could reduce the device’s life.

Additional components at risk
Additionally, other components can fail. These include:
* Batteries.
* Docking stations.
* Display monitors.

-Examine guidelines for replacing hardware-

When a hardware device fails, you usually have to replace it. To minimize the risk of a replacement device failing, adhere to the following guidelines:
* When you install a device, take care to minimize the risk of damage during the installation process.
* Eliminate support issues by choosing replacement devices that are compatible with Windows 10.
* Follow your organization’s process for replacing hardware devices, including how to discard storage devices.
* Update the incident report after you replace the device and resolve the issue.

-Diagnose memory problems—

Running the Windows Memory Diagnostics tool
The Windows Memory Diagnostic tool includes three different testing levels: Basic, Standard, and Extended. Press F1 while a test is running to access the Windows Memory Diagnostics tool options, which include:
* Test mix. Select which type of test to run.
* Cache. Select the cache setting for each test.
* Pass count. Set the number of times that the test mix will repeat the tests.

-Diagnose and troubleshoot disk problems-

Replace failed disks in redundant storage
 If a disk in a mirrored volume fails, you should perform the following steps:
* Connect a new disk to the Windows computer.
* Remove the failed disk from the mirror by using the Disk Management tool.
* Add a mirror that includes an operational disk from the previous mirror, and then add a new disk by using the Disk Management tool.

If a disk fails that is in parity, or a two-way or three-way mirror storage space, you should perform following steps:
* Connect the new disk to the Windows computer.
* Add a new disk to the storage pool in the Storage Spaces app.
* Remove the failed disk from the storage pool in the Storage Spaces app.
