Troubleshoot device driver failures 

Before you troubleshoot the failure of a device driver, you need to understand the role of device drivers in Windows.
A device driver is a small software program that allows a computer to communicate with its hardware or devices.
A hardware device works only if its device driver is installed correctly and functions properly. 
Device drivers are specific to operating systems, and they run with system-wide privileges.

-Examine tools for managing and troubleshooting device drives-

The Device Manager tool

You can open Device Manager in one three ways, including by:
* Right-clicking the Start icon, and then selecting Device Manager.
* Selecting Start, typing Device Manager or devmgmt.msc, and then pressing Enter.
* Selecting the Device Manager node in Computer Management.

You also can perform many tasks in Device Manager, including:
* Viewing a list of connected devices.
* Viewing detailed properties for the connected devices. 
* Uninstalling a device.
* Enabling or disabling devices.
* Troubleshooting devices.
* Updating device drivers.
* Rolling back drivers.

Use driver roll back

To roll back a driver, use the following procedure:
1. Open Device Manager.
2. Right-click the device to roll back, and then select Properties.
3. In the Properties dialog box, select the Drivers tab, and then select Roll Back Driver.
4. In the Driver Package rollback dialog box, select Yes.

System Restore
In rare cases, after you install a device or update a device driver, a computer might not start. This problem might occur because:
* The new device or driver causes conflicts with other drivers on the computer.
* A hardware-specific issue occurs.
* The installed driver is damaged.

-Manage signed drives-

Device drivers run with system-level privileges and can access files or information on a computer. Therefore, it's critical to trust installed device drivers. Trust, in this context, includes two main principles:
* Authenticity. 
* Integrity.

The Signature Verification tool
To remove an unsigned device driver, follow these steps:
1. Run Sigverif.exe to scan for unsigned drivers.
2. Review the resulting log file.
3. Create a temporary folder for the unsigned driver storage.
4. Manually move any unsigned drivers from C:\WIndows\System32\Drivers into the temporary folder.
5. Disable or uninstall the associated hardware devices.
6. Restart the computer.
Stage device drivers

Benefits of staging driver packagesImproved security.

Device drivers run as part of the operating system, so it is critical that you allow only known and authorized device drivers to run. Staging device-driver packages on Windows provides several benefits, including:
* Improved security. 
* Reduced support costs.
* Better user experience. 

-Stage device drivers manually-

You can use the following steps to use the Pnputil.exe command-line tool to add a device driver to the Windows driver store manually:
1. Obtain a digitally signed driver package.
2. Sign in as Administrator, and then open a command prompt.
3. At the command prompt, type pnputil.exe /add-driver package_name, and then press Enter.
4. The command runs, and Windows verifies the driverâ€™s integrity and digital signature, and then copies the driver into the driver store.

-Manage the driver store-

You can use the Pnputil.exe command-line tool to perform the following tasks:
* Add a driver package to the driver store.
* Add a driver package to the driver store, and then install it in the same operation.
* Delete a driver package from the driver store.
* List all driver packages in the driver store.
