Provide apps to users


In your organization, you may face scenarios in which certain app-deployment methods are better for your organization than other methods.
In this module, you'll learn about traditional app-deployment methods and methods that you can use to help to automate app deployment.

-Explore types of Windows apps-

Desktop apps
* Launching an .exe or .msi file from either product media, network location share, or downloaded from a website.
* As a package distributed from application management solution such as Endpoint Configuration Manager, typically used to automate & manage installations in an organization.

Universal Windows Platform apps
* More Secure.
* Cross-device Windows support.
* Easy Distribution. 
* Private Distribution.

App-V apps
* Run multiple versions of applications.
* Minimize application conflict. 
* Simplify application removal.
* Simplify application upgrades. 

RemoteApp apps
* Insufficient client hardware. 
* Incompatible OS.
* BYOD scenarios.

-Examine methods for deploying desktop apps-

Methods for deploying desktop apps include the following:
* Manual installation.
* Group Policy.
* Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager.
* Microsoft Intune.
* Virtualized applications.
* Remote applications.
* Inclusion in a Windows operating system image.

-Install desktop apps manually-

The Windows Installer service
Setup.exe files compared to MSI files
* An EXE file provides users with more control over the installation process.
* An EXE file actually triggers one or more MSI files.
* An EXE file does all this checking and abstracts away some of the complexity of installing your program.
* With an EXE file, you can optionally build a custom UI. 
* No leftover artifacts when uninstalling apps that were installed using an MSI package.

-Automate desktop app installation-

Automating installation by using Group Policy
* The target computers must belong to an AD DS domain.
* You must package the software in the Windows Installer .msi file format.
* User and computer accounts can be the targets of an app deployment.
* You can target a deployment at the domain level, the site level, or the organizational unit (OU) level.

Group Policy software deployment supports the following deployment types:
* Assign. 
* Publish. 

Group Policy software deployment has the following drawbacks:
* It can be difficult to determine whether a deployment is successful. 
* There is no prerequisite checking.
* There is no installation schedule.

Installation by using Endpoint Configuration Manager
* Collections.
* Multiple deployment types.
* Reporting. 
* Wake on LAN (WOL). 
* Software inventory, software metering, and Asset Intelligence.

-Install Microsoft 365 apps-

Microsoft 365 deployment options
* Click-to-run
* Configuration Manager.
* Microsoft Intune.
* The Office Deployment Tool (ODT).
* App-V.
* Remote Desktop Service (RDS).
