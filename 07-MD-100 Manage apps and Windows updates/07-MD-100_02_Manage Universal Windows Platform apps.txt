Manage Universal Windows Platform apps

The Microsoft Store is where you acquire Universal Windows apps.
Typically, these apps do not consume much memory or have excessive processor demands.
In Windows 8.1, Universal Windows apps run in full-screen mode in the new Windows UI.
In Windows 10 and later, Universal Windows apps run in resizable windows similar to traditional desktop apps.
