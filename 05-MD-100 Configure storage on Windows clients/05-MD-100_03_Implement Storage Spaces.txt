Implement Storage Spaces

Managing multiple physical disks attached directly to a computer can often be a tedious task for administrators. 
To overcome this problem, many organizations use SANs that group physical disks together.
SANs require specialized configuration and sometimes specialized hardware, which makes them expensive
To overcome these issues, you can use the Storage Spaces feature.
It pools disks together, and presents them to the operating system as a single disk.
