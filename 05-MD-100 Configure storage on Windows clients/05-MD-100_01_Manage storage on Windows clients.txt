Manage storage on Windows clients


Although you can save files to the local hard disk in Windows client, several additional storage options are available. 
This module describes some of the different storage technologies, including different types of server-based and cloud-based storage.
You can use disk management tools to perform disk-related tasks, such as creating and formatting partitions and volumes, assigning drive letters, and resizing disks.


-Understand storage options- 

Local hard disk

Advantage of using local hard disks include:
* Availability
* Performance

Disadvantage of using local hard disks include:
* Backup
* Physical failures

Virtual hard disk

Advantage of using virtual hard disks include:
* Portability
* Backup

Disadvantage of using virtual hard disks include:
* Performance
* Physical failures

-Service-based storage-

Advantage of using server-based storage include:
* Redundancy
* Backup
* Performance

Disadvantage of using server-based storage include:
* Availability
* Performance

Examine network and cloud storage options
* NAS
* SAN
* Cloud based storage
* OneDrive
* Azure storage

-Describe Master Boot Record and Grid Partition Table partitions-

MBR disks
Features of MBR dials
* Four partitions on each disk
* A 2 TB-maximum partition size
* No redundancy provided

GPT disks
Features of GPT disks
* 128 partitions per disk
* 18 exabytes of volume size
* Redundancy

-Describe dynamic disks-

Basic disks vs. dynamic disks

Disk type (Basic disks)
Advantages
* Compatible with most operating systems.
* Convert to dynamic disk without data loss.

Disadvantages
* Only uses contiguous space on one disk.
* Limited number of partitions on MBR disks.

Disk type (Dynamic disks)
Advantages
* Multi Disk volumes.
* Fault-tolerant volumes.
* 1024 volumes on MBR disks.
Disadvantages
* Only compatible with Windows.
* Does not convert to basic disk without data loss.

-Explore disk management tools-

Disk Management
DiskPart
Windows PowerShell 5.0

Disk Management
* Simple partition creation
* Disk conversion
* Extend and shrink partitions 

DiskPart
* List disk
* Select disk number
* Convert gpt

Windows PowerShell
* Get-Disk
* Clear-Disk
* Initialize-Disk
* Set-Disk
* Get-Volume

-Describe simple volumes-

Simple volume characteristics
* Not fault-tolerant. Disk failure leads to volume failure.
* Volume I/O performance is the same as disk I/O performance.
