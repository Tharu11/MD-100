Maintain disks and volumes


The storage functionality in Windows can give you an overview of what types of files the volumes are storing.
When you first create a volume, you typically create new files and folders on a volumeâ€™s available free space in contiguous blocks.
This provides an optimized file system environment. As the volume becomes full, the availability of contiguous blocks diminishes.
