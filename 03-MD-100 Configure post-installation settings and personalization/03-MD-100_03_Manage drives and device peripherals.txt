Manage drives and device peripherals


You'll learn the function drivers serve and how you can install them in Windows. 
You'll also learn more about tools for managing device peripherals
This module also focuses on configuring printer drivers and understanding the printing components in a Windows environment.

-Examine device drives-

Installing Drives Manually
* The hardware is older and not available from Windows Update.
* The hardware driver is only provided by the manufacturer.
* The scenario may call for a different driver from the manufacturer other than the one provided to Microsoft.

A driver package is a set of files that make up a driver. A driver package includes:
* The .inf file.
* Any files that the .inf file references.
* The catalog (.cat) file that contains the digital signature of the device driver.
Manage device peripherals

Devices in the Settings app
Devices in the Control Panel

Device Manager

You can use Device Manager to:
* Install and update device drivers
* Disable or enable devices
* Use the Driver Roll Back feature
* Change resources that devices use, such as interrupt requests (IRQs)
* Troubleshoot device problems
* View devices that are connected currently to your network, and the resources that they're using
Examine printer configuration

Printing device
* Printer port
* Printer and printer driver

Methods for installing a printer
* Add a locally attached printing device automatically
* Manually browse for a shared network printer
* Find a printer in the directory
* Deploy printers by using Group Policy settings
* Deploy printers by using Group Policy preferences

-Understand Type 3 and 4 printer drives-

A Type 4 printer driver model provides the following benefits:
* Sharing a printer doesn't require adding extra drivers that match the client architecture.
* A single Type 4 driver can support multiple printer models.
* Driver files are isolated on a per-driver basis, which prevents potential driver file-naming conflicts.
* Driver packages are smaller and more streamlined than Type 3 drivers, and Type 4 drivers install faster than Type 3 drivers.
* Printer driver and the printer user interface can be deployed independently with Type 4 drivers.

-Manager client-side printing-

Typical operations include the following tasks:
* Changing printer properties, such as sharing, security, and advanced properties.
* Selecting your default printer.
* Viewing and managing your print queue.
* Pausing or resuming a printer's operation.
* Pausing, resuming, restarting, or canceling print jobs.
* Reordering print jobs in your print queue.

-Modifying printer properties-

You can modify printer behavior by configuring printer properties, such as the:
* General printer properties.
* Printer's physical location.
* Printer-sharing functionality.
* Ports that the printer uses.
* Times during which the printer is available.
* Number of print jobs that can spool at one time.
* Names of groups that are allowed to use the printer.

Manage print server properties
* Add and remove print servers.
* Add and delete printers.
* Add and manage drivers.
* Manage print queues.
* View and modify status of printers.
* Create custom filters to view printers that match certain criteria.
