Evaluate Windows client installation methods


* An organization would wipe the device and reimage it with the preferred Windows edition and configuration defined by IT.
* The traditional wipe and load process requires creating a custom Windows image for the organization. This method involves identifying and getting all the needed drivers and apps for reinstallation and significant engineering effort to implement the process. 
* Windows 10 introduced new alternatives to help simplify this process, allowing administrators to apply configurations to the existing installation instead of wiping the entire OS.
* If a current device has Windows 10 or 11 installed, the installation itself is likely okay. Instead of replacing the whole OS to get a specific configuration, administrators reconfigure the existing OS to the organizationâ€™s desired specifications, including the correct Windows edition.
