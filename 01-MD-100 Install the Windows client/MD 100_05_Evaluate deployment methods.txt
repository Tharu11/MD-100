-Explore imaging and autopilot-

What is Imaging?

* Imaging is creating a “snapshot” of a reference computer with the desired OS, configurations, and apps pre-installed and then deploying that snapshot to multiple computers.
* It copies the reference computer configuration to the target computer when deploying an image.
* This method has been the preferred use in medium and large organizations for years.

What is Autopilot?

* Windows 10 was the first to introduce Autopilot. 
* The concept behind Autopilot was to reduce the need to reimage machines. Typically, new devices come pre-installed with Windows on them by the hardware vendor, with the vendor’s preferred configuration. 
* Autopilot reconfigures the device to a clean Windows 10 or 11 install, providing an out-of-box experience while applying the organization’s desired configuration and applications. 
* Configuring a device using Autopilot is typically easier than creating and managing images.
