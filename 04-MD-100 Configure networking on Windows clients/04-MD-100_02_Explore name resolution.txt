Explore name resolution


Windows devices communicate over a network by using names in place of IP addresses.
Devices use name resolution to find an IP address that corresponds to a name, such as a host name. 

-Explain how name resolution works-

Methods for resolving names
* Locate domain controllers and global catalog servers
* Resolve IP addresses to host names
* Locate a mail server for email delivery

Depending on the configuration, Windows resolves host names by performing the following actions:
1. Checking whether the host name is the same as the local host name.
2. Searching the DNS resolver cache which is populated from the local Hosts file.
3. Sending a DNS request to its configured DNS servers.

Structure of DNS
* Forward lookup zones
* Reverse lookup zones

How names are resolved with DNS
* A workstation queries the local DNS server for the IP address www.microsoft.com.
* If the local DNS server does not have the information, it queries a root DNS server for the location of the .com DNS servers.
* The local DNS server queries a .com DNS server for the location of the microsoft.com DNS servers.
* The local DNS server queries the microsoft.com DNS server for the IP address of www.microsoft.com.
* The microsoft.com DNS server returns the IP address of www.microsoft.com to the local DNS server.
* The local DNS server returns the result to the workstation.
