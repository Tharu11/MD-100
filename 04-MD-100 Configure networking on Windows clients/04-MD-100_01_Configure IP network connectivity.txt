Configure IP network connectivity


Connecting a Windows client to a network has become a typically automatic process.
When Windows is installed, the default network drivers and settings are typically enough to get connected and locate a server or router that governs the network environment and provides the necessary information to the client connected to the local network.

Components of an IPv4 address

IPv4 uses 32-bit addresses. If you view an IPv4 address in its binary format, it has 32 characters as the following example shows:
11000000101010000000000111001000

IPv4 divides the address into four octets, as the following example shows:
11000000.10101000.00000001.11001000

To make the IP addresses more readable, binary representation of the address typically shows it in decimal form, as the following example shows:
192.168.1.200

In conjunction with a subnet mask, the address identifies:
   * The computerâ€™s unique identity, which is the host ID.
   * The subnet on which the computer resides, which is the network ID.

-Define subnets for IPv4 networks-

By using subnets, you can:
   * Use a single Class A, B, or C network across multiple physical locations.
   * Reduce network congestion by segmenting traffic and reducing broadcasts on each segment.
   * Overcome the limitations of current technologies, such as exceeding the maximum number of hosts that each segment can have.

-Implement automatic IPv4 addressing-

Static configuration
   * IPv4 address
   * Subnet mask
   * Default gateway
   * Domain Name System (DNS) server

DHCPv4
   * Include resilience in your DHCP service design so that the failure of a single server does not prevent the service from functioning.
   * Configure the scopes on the DHCP server carefully. If you make a mistake, it can affect the whole network, and it can prevent communication.

-Examine tools for troubleshooting network connections-

Windows includes a number of tools that you can use to diagnose network problems, including:
   * Event Viewer
   * Windows Network Diagnostics
   * IPConfig
   * Ping
   * Tracert
   * NSLookup
   * Pathping
   * Windows PowerShell

-Examine IPv6 addressing-

Benefits of IPv6
   * Large address space
   * Hierarchical addressing and routing infrastructure
   * Stateless and stateful address configuration
   * Required support for Internet Protocol security (IPsec)Restored end-to-end communication
   * Prioritized delivery
   * Support for single-subnet environments
   * Extensibility


IPv6 address types
   * Unicast
   * Global unicast addresses
   * Link-local addresses
   * Unique local unicast addresses.
   * Multicast
   * Anycast
