Configure and manage file access

You can control user access to files by configuring file and folder permissions.
If file permissions are supported by the file system, such as NTFS or ReFS, you can configure permissions at different levels.
You also can assign permissions explicitly or you can inherit them from the higher levels.
If you're unsure whether you can inherit permissions, you can use the effective permissions feature to review what type of permissions a user or group has to a file.

-Understand file and folder permissions-

Permissions example

Types of permissions
* Basic permissions
* Advanced permissions

-Understand permission inheritance-

Two ways that you can assign permissions to files and folders
* Explicit permissions
* Inherited permissions

-Implement conditions to limit file and folder access-

When you specify conditions:
You use a Group condition so that you can specify that the permission will apply to the user based on the following group-membership rules:
   * Member of Any of the specified groups.
   * Member of Each of the specified groups.
   * Not Member of Any of the specified groups.
   * Not Member of Each of the specified groups.

You use a Device condition so that you can specify that the permission will apply if a user accesses the file from a specified computer or computers. The next unit provides more detail about this condition.

-Examine permissions when copying and moving files-

Effects of copying files and folders
* When you copy a file or folder within a single volume, the copy of the folder or file inherits the permissions of the destination folder.
* When you copy a file or folder to a different volume, the copy of the folder or file inherits the permissions of the destination folder.
* When you copy a file or folder to a volume that doesn't support permissions (non-NTFS and non-ReFS), such as a FAT file system, the copy of the folder or file loses its permissions. This is because the target volume doesn't support permissions.

The Copy command isn't aware of the security settings on folders or files.
* Xcopy has the /o switch to include Ownership and ACL settings.
* Robocopy has several switches that cause security information to be copied:
   * /Copy:copyflag(s) the default setting is the equivalent of /Copy:DAT where D=Data, A=Attributes, and T=Timestamps. You can add the S flag where S=Security, such as NTFS ACLs.
   * /Sec is the equivalent of /Copy:DATS.
