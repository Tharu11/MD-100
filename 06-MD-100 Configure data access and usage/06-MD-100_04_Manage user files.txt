Manage user files

An organization should have a defined strategy for how files should be stored and managed.
Standard best practices are for files to be stored on a file server, cloud service, or some form of redundant storage to ensure data is not lost.
Client devices eventually suffer hardware failure, as well as the risk of the device getting stolen or data corruption.
End users typically donâ€™t take adequate steps on their own to ensure data is not lost during such an event.

* Use existing file server management technologies, such as file classification and folder quotas, to manage user data
* Specify security policies to instruct user's PCs and devices to encrypt Work Folders and use a lock screen password
* Use Failover Clustering with Work Folders to provide a high-availability solution

Deploying Work Folders
* Obtain SSL certificates
* Create DNS records
* Install Work Folders on file servers
* Binding the SSL certificate on the sync servers
* Create security groups for Work Folders
