Explore authentication


You'll learn about the different sign in and service accounts and how to configure these accounts. You'll also learn how Credential Manager can be used to manage and store credentials for users. Lastly, you'll be introduced to Windows Hello, which is used to simplify the user sign in process.


-Explore authentication and authorization-

* A system administrator defines permissions for system resources initially.
* A system or application verifies users’ permission values when users attempt to access or update a system resource.

Windows authentication

* Kerberos version 5 protocol
* NTLM
* Certificate mapping


-Explore user account types-

* Local Account
* Microsoft Account
* Domain Account


Which Account Type Should You Choose?

* Organizations typically use Active Directory
* For home or personal use, a Microsoft Account offers many features that a local account does not


Manage local users and groups

* Default local user accounts
* Administrator account
* Default Account
* Default local system accounts


Managing users and using account groups

To create a local account, on Windows Home and Windows Professional editions:

1. Select the Start button, then select Settings > Accounts > Family & other people > Add someone else to this PC.
2. Enter a user name, password, password hint, and then select Next.

On Windows Enterprise edition:

1. Select the Start button, then select Settings > Accounts > Other people > Add someone else to this PC.
2. At the bottom of the page, select I don't have this person's sign in information, and at the bottom of the next page, select 
Add a user without a Microsoft account.
3. Enter a user name, password, password hint, and then select Next.

The Settings app doesn't display default accounts or account groups. To manage these, use the local Computer Management Microsoft Management Console (MMC).

1. Right-click on Start and select Computer Management.
2. Under System Tools, expand the Local Users and Groups option and select either Users or Groups to show the respective accounts objects.

Using Groups

* Administrators
* Users
* Guests
* Device Owners
* Event Log Readers
* Hyper-V Administrators
* Network Configuration Operators
* Remote Desktop Users

-Explore domains and workgroups-

What is a Workgroup?
* During installation, Windows creates a default Workgroup called “WORKGROUP”.
* A Workgroup can share files, network storage, printers, and any connected resource.
* There's no centralization of user accounts and related security policies and settings.
* It's a peer-to-peer network, in which each device has its own set of user and group accounts, its own security policy, and its own resources that you can share with others.


Workgroups include the following attributes:

* All computers have equal rights.
* Can’t be password protected.
* Has a limit of 20 computers.
* All computers must be on same local network.
* Works on all Windows versions.
* Works on both IP versions: IPv4 and IPv6.
* Every computer must have the same workgroup name to communicate.
* Requires security and sharing permissions to be set.

What is a Domain?

* A domain is an administrative boundary
* A domain is a replication boundary
* A domain is an authentication boundary


-Explore credential manager-

How to use Credential Manager

1. Open the Windows Control Panel. Select User Accounts
2. Choose to manage either Web Credentials or Windows Credentials.
3. Select the expansion next to a credential.
4. You can Edit or Remove the credential

-Explore Windows Hello-

Using Windows Hello instead of passwords

* Strong passwords can be difficult to remember, and users often reuse passwords on multiple sites.
* Server breaches can expose symmetric network credentials (passwords).
* Passwords are subject to replay attacks.
* Users can inadvertently expose their passwords due to phishing attacks.

Windows Hello for Business

Windows Hello for Business lets users authenticate to:

* A Microsoft account
* An Active Directory account
* A Microsoft Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) account
* Identity Provider Services or Relying Party Services that support Fast ID Online (FIDO) v2.0 authentication (in progress)


A user profile contains:

* The user part of the registry. User profiles contain a file called NTuser.dat. This file is the user part of the registry. 
* A set of folders. For each user who signs in, Windows creates a separate subfolder with the user’s name in the Users folder. 
This folder is a container for applications, user settings, and data that is organized into several subfolders, including:

   * Application configuration files, which are in the AppData folder
   * Desktop
   * Favorites
   * Documents
   * Downloads
   * Music, Pictures, Videos
   * Other folders that specific applications creat
