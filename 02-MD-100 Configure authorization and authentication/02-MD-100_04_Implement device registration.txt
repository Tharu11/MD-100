Implement device registration


When a device is joined to a domain, users can access company resources without having to enter their credentials every time they access company resources. Users can have a similar experience from a device that you enable for Device Registration, but without requiring the device to be a domain member.

-Understand the challenges to data access for multiple device types-

New challenges to IT departments include:

* Allowing users to work on devices of their choice, while providing consistent access to corporate resources.
* Allowing users to access resources in remote locations, such as work-at-home.
* Unifying the environment and providing unified applications and device management of the company-owned and domain-owned devices along with BYOD devices.
* Protecting company data, enforcing company policies and compliance requirements, and managing risks regardless of where data is accessed, or from which device.

-Explore the Microsoft device strategy framework-

* On your own
* Bring your own device (Bring your own unmanaged device, Bring your own managed device
* Choose your own device (also called CYOD)
* Here’s your own device

-Explore device registration-

* The device is associated with the user's account in the company directory.
* The device object is created in AD DS.
* The user certificate is installed on the device.

-Examine how device registration works-

The main purposes of the Device Registration feature are to provide:

* Registration in AD DS for non-domain joined devices.
* SSO for selected applications and resources in a company’s internal network.

Assess infrastructure requirements to support device registration
Device Registration feature

* Active Directory environment.
* Public key infrastructure.
* AD FS.
* Device Registration Service. 
* A DNS record for the host named Enterprise registration.
* Web Application Proxy.
* A supported operating system on the device.

Register and enroll devices

1. Open the Start menu, select the Settings option, and then select Accounts.
2. On the Accounts page, select Access work or school.
3. On the Access work or school page, select Connect.
4. Enter the user ID with which you want to register the device. The user ID looks the same as a user’s email address and is composed of the user’s sign-in name, the at sign (@), and a domain suffix. Domain administrators refer to user ID as the user principal name (UPN). When performing a device registration, the computer tries to resolve the Enterprise registration name, and verifies that the SSL certificate is trusted and still valid.
5. Enter user domain credentials. The device can be a workgroup member, but the user must have a domain account to enable Device Registration on the device.
6. Once the device is enabled for Device Registration, Device Registration Service creates a domain object for the joined device in the Registered Devices AD DS container, and the user is provided with a certificate for client authentication.
