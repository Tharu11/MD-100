Manage users and groups


Managing individual accounts and permissions on each device doesn't scale when devices are used in an organization. Centralized management is key to ensuring that users are able to access the information they need, while protecting that same information against unauthorized users.

Characteristics of AD DS

* AD DS is a true directory service, with a hierarchical X.500-based structure.
* AD DS uses Domain Name System (DNS) for locating resources such as domain controllers.
* You can query and manage AD DS by using Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) calls.
* AD DS primarily uses the Kerberos protocol for authentication.


Characteristics of Azure AD

* Azure AD is primarily an identity solution, and it’s designed for internet-based applications by using HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) communications.
* Azure AD is a multi-tenant directory service.
* Azure AD users and groups are created in a flat structure, and there are no OUs or GPOs.
* You can’t query Azure AD by using LDAP; instead, Azure AD uses the REST API over HTTP and HTTPS.
