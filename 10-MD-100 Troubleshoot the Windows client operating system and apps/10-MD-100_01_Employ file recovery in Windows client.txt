Employ file recovery in Windows client

Your organization most likely has a file recovery strategy in place to recover user data that is stored on network file servers or network-accessible storage devices.
However, it is important to remember that users often save their work to their local devices.
Therefore, it is important that you provide some method of local file recovery, so that you can recover these data files if users delete them accidentally or they become corrupt.

-Explain the importance of file recovery-

Storing all data remotely is not always possible. Therefore, you must be able to recover local data in case of hardware failure or other scenarios, such as:

* A user accidentally modifies or deletes a file or an entire folder.
* Malware or a virus infects a computer and modifies or encrypts user files.
* A user modifies a file several times, but later decides that the changes were unnecessary and wants to access the original file.
* A natural disaster occurs, such as a fire, flood, or tornado, and damages the computer.
* A user’s data does not synchronize with the file server regularly, and then is stolen. The user wants to access newer versions of data.

A computer stores data files and settings in several locations, and you need to ensure that you protect all of them. Windows includes several tools that can help you protect data and make backup copies of local files, including
* Folder Redirection and Offline Files tools.
* Work Folders tool.
* File History tool.
* Backup and Restore (Windows 7) tool.
* Synchronization of user data with Microsoft OneDrive.
* Creation of a system image.
* Wbadmin.exe tool.
* File Explorer or robocopy.exe features. 

-Explain file history-

File History saves files from the following folders: Contacts, Desktop, Documents, Downloads, Favorites, Links, Music, OneDrive, Pictures, Saved Games, Searches, and Videos. Additionally, File History saves files from the following libraries: Documents, Music, Pictures, and Videos.

You can protect additional folders by using File History in two ways:
* Using the Backup option in the Update & security section in the Settings app. To access this option, in the Settings app, select Update & security. Select Backup, and then in the Back up using File History section, select More options.
* Adding folders to the libraries that File History protects. File History also protects folders that you add to one of the protected libraries. You can do this by configuring File Explorer to show libraries, and then modifying the library properties to include additional folders. If you create a new library, File History automatically protects it.

-Compare file recovery options-

Each Windows file recovery option has specific requirements and benefits. All options provide protection for and recovery of files and folders on NTFS volumes. However, there are important differences in their functionality. For example, when you're considering which file recovery option to use, ask yourself:
* How often does an option create backups of the protected content?
* What kind of content and file systems does an option protect?
* Can an option protect and recover a computer’s system state?
* Can I use a different computer to recover content than the device on which I created it?

Windows provides two file recovery options: File History, and the Backup and Restore (Windows 7) tool. You don't need to install any features to use these options, but first you must configure them. If you need to recover files that you protect with either of these options, you can use the Previous Versions feature. Windows doesn't include Azure Backup. Therefore, before you can use Azure Backup to recover files, you must:
* Purchase a Microsoft Azure subscription.
* Create a backup vault.
* Install the Microsoft Azure Backup agent.
* Register the computer with the backup vault.
