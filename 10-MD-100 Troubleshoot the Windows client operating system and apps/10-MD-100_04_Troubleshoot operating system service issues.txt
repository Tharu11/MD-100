Troubleshoot operating system service issues

Failures of an operating system service often result in problems that are not severe enough to prevent the computer from starting, but are enough to restrict functionality. 
Therefore, it is important that you understand how to identify and resolve service-related startup problems.

Occasionally, account lockouts can occur for other, less obvious reasons than repeated, failed interactive sign-in attempts, including that:

* Users sign in to multiple computers.
* Passwords for service accounts have changed.
* Persistent drive mappings are used.

-Identify sign-in errors-

You can resolve most errors that pertain to sign in issues quickly once you identify the issue. You can use the following methods and tools to help troubleshoot sign-in issues:
* On-screen errors.
