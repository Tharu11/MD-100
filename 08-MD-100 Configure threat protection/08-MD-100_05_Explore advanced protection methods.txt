Explore advanced protection methods

Part of protecting Windows is to take a defense-in-depth approach.
Threats come in many forms and can target a variety of specific services or applications.
Administrators should assume that no single solution will be able to mitigate all threats and should be familiar with the tools and settings available to help secure devices.

Windows security baselines
You can use security baseline to:
* Ensure that user and device configuration settings are compliant with the baseline.
* Set configuration settings. For example, you can use Group Policy, Endpoint Configuration Manager, or Microsoft Intune to configure a device with the setting values specified in the baseline.
Use AppLocker to control applications

Todayâ€™s organizations face a number of challenges in controlling which applications run on client computers. These challenges include controlling:
* The Universal Windows and desktop apps that users can access.
* Which users are allowed to install new applications.
* Which versions of the applications are allowed to run, and for which users.

-AppLocker benefits-

AppLocker can be useful for organizations that want to:
* Limit the number and types of applications that can run. This can be done by preventing unlicensed software or malware from running, and by restricting the ActiveX controls that are installed.
* Reduce the total cost of ownership by ensuring that workstations are homogeneous across an enterprise, and that users run only the software and applications that the enterprise approves.
* Reduce the security risks and possibility of information leaks from running unauthorized software.

AppLocker rules
The four wizards that AppLocker provides administrators with to author rules are:
* Executable Rules Wizard
* Windows Installer Rules Wizard
* Script Rules Wizard
* Packaged App Rules Wizard
