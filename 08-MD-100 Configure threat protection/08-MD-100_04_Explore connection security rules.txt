Explore connection security rules

Windows doesn't authenticate or encrypt connections made from one computer to another, by default. 
However, by configuring and using connection security rules, you can verify the identity of each computer that is communicating.
You also can encrypt the connection between those computers, and then ensure that no tampering has occurred with respect to the transmission between the two computers.

-Explain IPSec-

IPsec
* Offers mutual authentication both before and during communications.
* Forces both parties to identify themselves during the communication process.
* Enables confidentiality through IP traffic encryption and digital-packet authentication.

IPsec modes
IPsec has two modes:
* Encapsulating security payload (ESP). This mode encrypts data using one of several available algorithms.
* Authentication Header (AH). This mode signs traffic, but doesn't encrypt it.

Connection security rules
* Server isolation. 
* Domain isolation.
